# Spur_gear_application

This is a C++ console application that automates the design procedure for a pair of spur gear. 
This is an initial version of the application and it is only integrated with 4 materials and is not well optimised. 
The prerequisite needed for execution are -

1. Power of the motor which is coupled with the driving gear
2. Velocity ratio (Gear ratio)
3. Diameter of gear/pinion
4. Velocity of gear/pinion


The Application solves for all the stresses that will be devolped in the gear and outputs whether the design is safe or not. 
It will also solve for the major physical dimensions of both gear and pinion.


To execute the program, enter into src directory and run ./build.sh
