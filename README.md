# Spur_gear_application

This is a C++ console application developed in Visual studio 2019 which automates the design procedure for a pair of spur gear. 
This is an initial version of the application and it is only integrated with 4 materials and is not well optimised. Also a proper UI has not yet been devolped. 
The prerequisite needed for execution are -

1. Power of the motor which is coupled with the driving gear
2. Velocity ratio (Gear ratio)
3. Diameter of gear/pinion
4. Velocity of gear/pinion


The programme solves for all the stresses that will be devolped in the gear and outputs whether the design is safe or not. 
It will also solve for the major physical dimensions of both gear and pinion.
